  ;; By default monky spawns a seperate hg process for every command.
  ;; This will be slow if the repo contains lot of changes.
  ;; if `monky-process-type' is set to cmdserver then monky will spawn a single
  ;; cmdserver and communicate over pipe.
  ;; Available only on mercurial versions 1.9 or higher
